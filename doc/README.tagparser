Tag Types
~~~~~~~~~

Basic
=====

Tagname: some data
Tagname2: some other data

Basic Multiline

Starttag:
data1
data2
Gattrats:

i.e. the endtag is the reversed starttag with only the first letter
capitalized.

Language dependant
==================

Tagname: english text
Tagname.de: deutscher Text
Tagname.de_AT: österreicher Text

Language dependant multi line (Selection style)
===============================================

Tagname.de:
data1
data2
Temangat.de:


Language dependant multi line (YOU style)
=========================================

Tagname.german:
data1
data2
Namreg.emangat:


There are also different actions what to do with Language tags. It
is possible to have the localized version replace the original value
or to have in fact two different tags, one without locale and
another tag which can only hold locale specific data (see selections
for example).



How to use the naked Tagparser (y2util/TagParser.h)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Call lookupTag with a stream as argument and the Tagparser will read
the stream until it finds something which is seperated by a colon.
(e.g Label: bla blub) Now call startTag to retrieve a string which
contains the name of the Tag found (e.g Label). Depending of your
knowledge of the tag you can either call retrieveData to get
remaining data on the line (bla blub). Alternative you can call
parseData with a Endtag as Argument, in this case the Tagparser will
continue parsing until it finds Endtag. retrieveData will return
everything between the start and endtag then.

How to use the CommonPkdTagParser (y2util/CommonPkdParser.h)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CommonPkdTagParser operates with Tags and a TagSet. The Tag class
stores data about a tag and information about how to deal with it
when found in a file (single line or multi line, locale or not
locale). TagSet holds map which associates Tagname with Tag objects.
After calling your parsers startTag function, you just have to give
the assing function of the Tagset the stream, parser and tagname. It
then searches if is responsible for the tag and if so, calls the
tag's assign function. This function in turn will take the
neccessary actions to retreive the data and maybe overwrite its
contents because of a better matching locale. It return whether it
has done this successfully or not. See InstSrcCommonPkd.cc for
coding example.
